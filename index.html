            The New Orleans Democratic Socialists of America will be replacing brake lights for free for anyone who needs them. The supplies are free, and we will have trained volunteers to install them.

            If you can't make this one, we will be hosting an additional clinic on 9/16 at Barrone &amp; Euterpe from 10 am to 3 pm!

                <p>Finally, the New Orleans Chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America is here!</p>
<p>Democratic Socialists of America is the largest socialist organization in the country. We believe that our community — like the United States at large — needs Democratic Socialism as a remedy for the oppression of capitalism. This means that we believe in housing and healthcare as a right rather than a privilege, in living wages for all, in fighting for feminism and civil rights.</p>
<p>Our organization also believes in fighting for local issues at a grassroots level. New Orleans is an amazing, one-of-a-kind city with unique problems all its own. We’re here to fight for environmental justice as our coastline is ravaged. We stand in solidarity with service workers in desperate need of better wages, with union workers fighting for a better quality of life. Everyone in New Orleans deserves housing despite the city’s shameful, rapid gentrification. We stand in opposition to the rampant racial and LGBT discrimination throughout the city. Simply put, we’re here to dismantle the injustices taking place in a city we love.</p>
<p>The New Orleans Democratic Socialists of America is not a political party: it is a movement from the ground up. <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/PGwzoWr7tdQqqR3w1" target="_blank" rel="external">Join us</a> in building a better future today!</p>
